# Neural-Network-Using-Genetic-Algorithm-
The project aims to explore the methods of neural network weight adaptation using Genetic Algorithm. The neural network structure used is a single layer feed forward network, which maps a vector of inputs to the outputs given in the image. The weights are initially generated randomly.
